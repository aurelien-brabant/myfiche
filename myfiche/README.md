# myfiche

Myfiche *was* a modest website built for educational purpose.

This repository contains the code of the V3 (the previous versions were build using bare-bones HTML, CSS, and PHP).
This version is built using NodeJS && mongoDB. Therefore it includes both front-end and back-end.

This website has been my first "real" experience in web development. It is dirty, badly optimized, but it is there.

I think this is interesting to see where everything started.
